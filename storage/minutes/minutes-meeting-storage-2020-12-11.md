## Status of Last Action Points

*	CI has been done for database.
* Gluster volume is expanded using the pvc.
* Downtime calculation has been done by checking the pod status.

## Discussed Issues

* Optimize the required storage first then expand that.
* How volume can be shrink using Gusterfs (creating a new volume and transfer the previous data on that).
* Should we proceed with Glusterfs or change the current plan.
* What is the further step for database.


## Action Points

*	Take more training data and generalize ml model with different ingestion rate.
* Check how to shrink volume in Hostpath and is it possible to do the same thing by using Glusterfs?
