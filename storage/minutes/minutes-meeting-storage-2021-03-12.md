## Status of Last Action Points

*	Implementation of stable ingestion rate (per minute) for kafka to improve the performance of storage allocator.
* Generic ML model for InfluxDB.

## Discussed Issues

* How much headroom should be assigned for squid so that the allocated disk spaces never goes below the used disk spaces.
* Depicting prediction interval for several test run with small interval of time.  
* Ingestion rate computation with sliding windows for generic model of InfluxDB. 


## Action Points

*	Assign some headroom for squid and complete the remaining evaluation of kafka.
* Evaualuate the VNFs with prediction interval.
* Fix the problem with opcua connector and take new dataset for influxDb with different window size.
