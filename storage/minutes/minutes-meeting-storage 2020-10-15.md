## Status of Last Action Points

*	Changes have been done on Kafka configuration file and analyse its effect on storage consumption. 

## Discussed Issues

*	The way the confidence interval has been calculated is not correct. The graphs of three algorithm should be merged into a signle one. Confidence interval should be calculated based on three experiments(As an example for Disk Usage vs Ingested Message size it should be occured after five packets were ingested). Data will be ploted into a single graph from different experiments and will be identically distributed.


## Action Points

*	Have to get more clarity regarding the calculation of confidence interval and have to plot the graphs accordingly.
