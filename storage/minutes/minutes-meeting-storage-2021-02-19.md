## Participants

## Status of Last Action Points

*	Generic storage allocator model for Kafka is complete

## Discussed Issues

* Modifications of the current storage allocator model. 
* Evaluation of the storage allocator model for all three VNFs.
* Service function chain to validate the model. 
* Documentation tool and presentation idea.


## Action Points

*	Separate ML model training from the current storage allocator model into a separate file .
* Evaluate the current model for individual VNFs with the predicted storage amount against the actual used storage and find out accuracy. 
* Find out how the VNFs can be combined, i.e., which VNF can act as an http server for Squid. 
* Start preparing the documentation and attach a video in the presentation (showing how the storage allocator functions) to make it more interactive.
