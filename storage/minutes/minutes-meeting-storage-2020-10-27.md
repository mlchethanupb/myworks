## Status of Last Action Points

*	Confidence Interval of datasets from multiple independent test-runs is drawn.  

## Discussed Issues

* Discussion on leftover phase 1 tasks and how to proceed for phase 2.
* Based on the fact that response time may depend on multiple metrics, considering multiple regression plots to draw correlation between them.  


## Action Points

*	Use multiple metrics as regression algo input and plot against storage consumption. 
* Create isolated environments of cache and database, collect metrics data like message broker, find out new correlations for them.
* For Phase 2,instead of using RL, use the functions from phase1 analysis (Regression output).
