You should:

* Modify metadata.tex with your personal information
* Put your content into content.tex (add additional files and \input them if you like)
* Put figures into the figures subdirectory
* Read and understand preface.tex, but only modify it if you know what you are doing
* Read the section on PetPeeves and NEVER, EVER commit any of these mistakes!
