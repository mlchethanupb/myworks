\section{ PERFORMANCE EVALUATION}
\label{sec:pet-peeves}

\begin{itemize}

\item Simulation on NSFNET and ARPANET topologies
\item Results were compared with other methods.
\item Performance DDPG and DRL-TE was evaluated for each network topologies.

\subsection{Factors for comparisons}
\label{sec:orgheadline1}
\begin{itemize}

\item End to end delay
\item End to end throughput.
\item Total Utility.

\end{itemize}
