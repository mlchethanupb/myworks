MOM - 10 July 2020

	• Discussion on how different MAC protocol will effect transmission delay.
	• How interference will play a role in decreasing packet rate in wireless environment?
		○ Due to channel sharing (TDMA, FDMA..)
		○ Due to collisions.
	• MAC protocol comes into picture to avoid above problems.
	• Shannon capacity in wireless considers noise + interference
		○ Therefore shannon capacity = Blog2(1+SINR)
		○ SINR - Signal to Interference Noise Ratio.
		○ SINR = Received power/(Noise + interference)
		○ In wireless if interference caused by other nodes is less than the threshold, the transmission of other nodes will still happen. If interference is greater than threshold transmission will effect.
		○ Max data rate = shannon capacity
	• 1st Phase Implementation
		○ Implement RL MAC protocol. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00162.pdf
		○ Use calculated values of RL MAC protocol in SDN-IoT.
	• 2nd phase
		○ Improve RL MAC protocol and compare with phase 1 results.
	• Probable Time line
		○ No meeting on 24th July.
Probable dead line for 1st phase is October (depends on other teams as well).
