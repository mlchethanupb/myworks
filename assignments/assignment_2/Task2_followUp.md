# Task2 - follow up

**Objective**: adapt an environment and tune a solution

**Assignment**:

  1. All sub-groups should have the hop-count AND delay environments
  2. Bonus -> If possible:
    * compare two different solutions for the same problem (either hop-count or delay): 
        - think of advantages/disadvantages as points of comparisons (e.g., number of steps for convergence)
        - make sure that you compare the same thing (e.g., if delay is a point of comparision, then you calculate the delay in the same way)
    * Tune the hyper-parameters of the RL algorithms 


**Submission**:

   - At the end you will show a Demo of your RL agent (after training/learning). Codes should be submitted on Git. 
   - For the bonus parts, you need to show some graphs

**Deadline**: 26.June 2020
