# Task1

**Objective**: Learn RL tools and start with hands-on tutorials

**Assignment**:  Divide yourself into different groups to solve the following problems 

 - [Mountain Car](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCarContinuous-v0/)
 - [CartPole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/)
 - [Pendulum](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Pendulum-v0/)
 - [Taxi](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Taxi-v2/)

The environments are already implemented using [openAI gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) interface, but you can use a different version of the environment if you want to.

Get yourself familiar with the environment and choose any RL agent to solve the problem. Make sure that you choose the suitable agent!
