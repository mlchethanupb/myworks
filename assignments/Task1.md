# Task1

**Objective**: Learn RL tools and start with hands-on tutorials

**Assignment**:  Divide yourself into different groups to solve the following problems 

 - [Mountain Car](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCarContinuous-v0/)
 - [CartPole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/)
 - [Pendulum](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Pendulum-v0/)
 - [Taxi](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Taxi-v2/)

The environments are already implemented using [openAI gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) interface, but you can use a different version of the environment if you want to.

Get yourself familiar with the environment and choose any RL agent to solve the problem. Make sure that you choose the suitable agent!

**Submission**: At the end you will show a Demo of your RL agent (after training/learning). Codes should be submitted on Git.

**Deadline**: 

 - *Soft Deadline*: 31.May.2020. Have a running code - Do not worry if you have problems by then.
 - *Hard Deadline*: 05.June 2020. Everything should be working. The Demo will be after the mini-seminar presentations
