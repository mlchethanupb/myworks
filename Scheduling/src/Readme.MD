## Details :

The code base is divided into two phases. 
* Phase 1.
* Phase 2.

## Phase 1:

* It contains the code for the first phase of implentation. The implementation was based on the stacked 
representation of the observation space. Also, the observation space did not contain the backlog component.
* Custom logic for determination of cluster load.


## Phase 2:

* It contains the code for the second phase of implentation. The implementation was based on the image like 
representation of the observation space. Summarized backlog information also added in the observation space.
* Redesigned logic for cluster load calculation.

*Execution steps are specified in the folders phase1 and phase2.*
