## Problem Statement :

  It is all about making the system to learn resource management by its own.
  To overcome the drawbacks associated with  heuristic based solutions, Reinforcement learning approach is considered (Thanks to machine learning).
  Our team is currently working to reproduce the results.
	
## Proposal :

We are currently assuming that, the mind of job is known once it is arrived.

1) State : The jobs that are allocated currently to the resource, 
           the jobs in waiting list.
		   
2) Action : As an action, any number of jobs can be choosen from the waiting list.

3) Reward : Minimizing average slowdown.

This is our current proposal for the problem we have choosen.
