# Minutes of meeting from 2021-02-12

## Points discussed

- Discussion on different baseline approaches implemented. 
	- Random agent
	- DSDV + Weighted queue
	- DSDV + TDMA
	- DSDV + Probability of sending 
- Metrics to consider while comparison
	- Timesteps for centralized agent
	- Packet loss/delivered for decetralized agent  
- Add individual documentation, helps in evaluation. 
- As a bonus task implement MAC protocol to decide on what probability the nodes should send.  
- Discussed on implementing centralized critic model for MARL

## Action points

- Agreed on formulating and showing results untill now for the next week meeting
- Add Successive transmission as metric for the random agent and MARL

## Results discussed: 

- Results so far:
	- Num of agents: 6 
	- Collision domain: 2
	- Attack node 1
	- Number of packets per node : 5 (Total: 25)
 
	- Environment: Multi agent scenario
		- Packet delivered for 5000 episodes:
			- Random agent: 0.89
			- MARL agent: 22.9
	
	- Environment: Single Agent
	 	- Metric: Timesteps to transfer 25 packets for 5000 episodes
			- DSDV + Weighted queue: 31
			- RL Single agent: 36
			- DSDV + TDMA: 82(not mean)
