# Minutes of meeting from 2020-08-14

## Points Discussed:
- RL-MAC implemented codes for same and different range nodes and planned next steps (Details in PPT "20200814.odp")
- Modifications for the implementation.
- Modification for multihop transmision.

- Transmission of packets can be considered with 2 ways (fairness aspect): 
   - Sending packets of the node having more packets in the queue. (Penalize the agent if the nodes with less packets in the queue are sent over the one with high number of packet in queue)
   - All nodes sending packets at equal priority or equal waiting period for all the nodes. (Penalize the agent if nodes are waiting for long time) - Selected

- 2 cases of the transmission TCP and UDP
   - TCP: pop the packet from queue only when there is successful transmission. 
   - UDP: pop the packet when there is transmission. 

- Dynamically decide the collision domain.
- penalty for taking actions when queue is empty.
- plotting of mean reward and average timesteps taken in each episode for total packet transmission.(use tensorboard of stable-baselines) 

## Administrative
- Advisor not available in Paderborn at September 4th. Plan to reschedule depending on project progress and questions. 

## Action points
- Working model for multi-hop transmission.
- Plotting parameters.
