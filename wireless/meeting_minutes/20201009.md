# Minutes of meeting from 2020-09-18
## Points Discussed
- Team meeting started with presenting different performance graph for agent on different network topologies, dynamic and static attack nodes generarion.
- Dynamic attack/static attack node with smaller and larger network. (smaller network - 6 nodes, larger network - 11 nodes)
- Dynamic attack nodes with larger network most of the packets are lost due to collision- need hyper parameter tuning
- Dynamic attack node with smaller network few packets are lost due to collision
- No packet loss with static attack node for larger/smaller network.
- Convergence timing is very large for the network - need to hyperparameter tuning to converge fastly
- agent is learning to route the packet by avoiding attack nodes but its not avoiding packet loss due to collision
- Discussed different reward scenarios implemented in the code
- Penalty for taking longer path should be less than packet collision .(ex - penalty for longer path = -3, penalty for collision = -1000)
- Discussed on how to improve visualization using networkx
- Points to update on readme document - add motivation, improvise usage example

## Action points
- Reward should be given aiming to reduce collision of packet and not a long path.
- Update visualization of network and readme document
- Hyperparameter tuning
