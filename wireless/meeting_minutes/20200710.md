## Discussion
 
- How different MAC protocol will effect transmission delay.
- How interference will play a role in decreasing packet delivery rate in wireless environment?
    - Due to channel sharing (TDMA, FDMA..) 
    - Due to collisions.
- Shannon capacity in wireless considers noise + interference
- Shannon capacity = B*log2(1+SINR)
- SINR - Signal to Interference Noise Ratio =  (Received power / (Noise + interference))
- In wireless, if interference caused by other nodes is less than the threshold, the transmission of other nodes will still happen. If interference is greater than threshold transmission will effect.

## Implementation 

### Phase 1

- Implement RL MAC protocol. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00162.pdf)
- Use calculated values of RL MAC protocol in SDN-IoT.

### Phase 2

- Improve RL MAC protocol and compare with phase 1 results.

## Probable Timeline

- 1st phase - October (depends on other teams as well).​​​​​​​
