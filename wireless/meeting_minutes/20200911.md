# Minutes of meeting from 2020-09-11
- Duration: 13.00 - 14.20

## Points Discussed

- Queries regarding incorporating the SDN-IOT attack model into the wireless environment.
	- Detailed discussion on having next hop and transmit/ wait status in same action space.
	- Collision domain in environment and destination in state space will help in verifying and deciding reward for the right action. 
	- Limiting the action space to collision domain will help in faster reward convergence. Other way to do is having all nodes in the action space and giving negative reward for wrong action. Former requires preprocessing before deciding the action space. 
	- State space and action space can be deviated from original paper to adapt to our implemented wireless envronment

## Administrative

- Schedule appoitment with advisor if stuck with problem for longer duration, apart from the normal meetings. 

## Action Points

- Consider both next hop and transmit/wait status for action space.
- Incorporate attack model of SDN-IOT paper to our implemented wireless paper.
