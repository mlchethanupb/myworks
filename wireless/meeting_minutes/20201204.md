# Minutes of meeting from 2020-12-04

## Points discussed

- Team updated on the current status of all the tasks till now
  - Updating reward system to the agent and tuning
  - Progress on baseline algorithm (DSDV with TDMA) implementation
- Whether transfer learning approach is suitable for our agent or not
- Reviewing the current reward system
- Discussion on implementing OSPF for wireless network
- Comparing end to end delay in transmitting all the packets in baseline and in agent
- Try different RL algorithms only when time permits
- Feedback on entire team meeting

## Action points

- Tuning reward of phase one - high priority as it is required in MARL
- Multi agent reinforcement learning
- Implement baselines for comparison - Hopcounts, Packet loss and end to end delay in transmitting all packets as metrics
- Try multi agent reward system first and then try the same reward system in current model
