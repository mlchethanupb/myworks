# Minutes of meeting from 2021-01-22

## Points discussed

- Discussed improvements in results with modified reward systems for both decentralized and centralized system. 
- If all the work and documentation of the project is completed, as an additional task we can implement CSMA instead of TDMA, by adopting the backoff window and agent taking decesions based on probability for sending. And the probability of sendind is proportional to the number of nodes in the collision domain. 
- Discussed issue with baseline 2 implementation

## Action points

- Tuning MARL for better results.
- Testing the results of tuned model.
- Implement baseline 2
