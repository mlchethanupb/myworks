## ToC	
The weekly meeting was conducted by discussing on mini seminar and the mini project.The advisors put general remarks on them and then answered queries from the participants.
Later on the meeting, they talked on the second project. 
### Administrative	

- The deadline for the second project is on 12th June.

### Development	

- For the mini seminar presentation, keep the presentation length within 7-10 minutes and 8-10 slides at most. Try to make it short focusing on what 
problem you are dealing with and what RL approach to pursue to solve it according to the paper. Don't need to put detailing on application,background or motivation.

- About the intermediate report figures,need to make sure to describe each figure, what are the contexts and proper explanation of each part. 
Extract the figures in scalable manner to help your reader understand it better.

- Do not need to push the advisor or peer review on github, but work on the draft report to improve according to the reviews and submit the final one on github. 

- About the first mini project,it's okay to work on local VM or online VM like kaggle. Need to understand how the algorithm is working and can be able to modify the algorithm's meta parameters. 	

- If CPU capacity doesn't support execution of the algo, there is a tensor flow link which may come in handy "https://github.com/mdsimmo/tensorflow-community-wheels/releases"
-The second project should also be conducted in groups, not individually.

## Action points	
- [X] Install the VM and start working on applying RL algo on the given environments for the first project.
- [X] For the second project, create your own environment and solve it with the algorithms already implemented in the first project.
