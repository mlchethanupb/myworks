## ToC	
This weekly meeting primarily discussed issues related to the first assignment and introduced the second task. The advisors provided their recommendations on how to setup and subsequently use the VMs.
Organizational details for the presentation were also addressed.

### Administrative	

- Solutions to the first assignment will be presented on 5th June
- Solutions to the second assignment should be uploaded either until 5th June (soft deadline) or finally until 12th June (hard deadline) 
- Each topic should be presented within a 7-10 minute timeframe
- After the presentations are concluded, it is critical to be familiar with all presented topics, as questions will be asked!
- The distribution of who presents what OpenAI gym demos should be discussed internally


### Development	
- For the second assignment, an implementation of several networking environments as well as suitable RL agents to solve them are required
- At least four different combinations (network topology, metrics, ...) should be implemented
- A visual representation of the environment is not required (but appreciated)
- We assume fixed package sizes for incoming jobs
- The network-x library can be used to develop the network environment


## Action points	
- It is critical to gain hands-on experience with RL through the first and second assignment
- It should be tested whether the upgraded VMs sufficiently support RL libraries
